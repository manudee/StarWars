Game of Thromes jQuery Assignment

This is a jQuery based front end application which lets you select a player and a defender. You can then continue the game by hitting "attack". Each time attack is clicked, healthpoints of the player and opponent go down by a certain amount. The game is over when player's healthpoints reach 0 before that of the opponent.
